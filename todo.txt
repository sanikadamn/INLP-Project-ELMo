we have a text corpus thing
for that we need to build a vocabulary of unique tokens
each word will be represented as a vector of the letters or whatever
need a mapping between letters and the indices that the letters have
for training we need to convert the data into the next word format
window of size something
output while training willb e a softmax thing over the vocabulary
during inference, pass the sentence (context) through the lstm thing and get the embedding for each word
